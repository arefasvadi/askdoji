1. Run the following commands to compile:
`g++ -std=c++14 ./can-be-connected.cpp -o can-connect && g++ -std=c++14 ./change-date-formats.cpp -o date-format` or use CMake to do a build in another folder.

2. At the top of each file a test case is provided and when the program is run, those tests are performed.


3. Explanation has been provided in the code, but basically for the change-date-format, I utilized regular expressions with string manipulation, and for graph search problem I used BFS.

4. One thing to note is that I was not clear if your intention was to have a specific implementation and object hierarchy of objects.
